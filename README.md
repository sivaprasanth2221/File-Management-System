# File Management System

This is a simple file management system implemented in C. It allows users to perform various operations on a text file such as saving text to a file, viewing file content, obtaining file size, getting file details, clearing the file, and deleting the file.

## Features

- Save text to a file
- View file content
- Obtain file size
- File details including size, drive letter saved, creation time, and modification time
- Clear the file contents
- Delete the file

## Getting Started

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone sivaprasanth2221/File-Management-System-using-c`
2. Compile the program using a C compiler (`gcc` recommended) by running `gcc file_management_system.c -o file_management_system`
3. Run the compiled executable by executing `./file_management_system` (on Unix/Linux) or `file_management_system.exe` (on Windows)

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose various options to perform operations on a text file. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu and perform actions.

## Dependencies

This program uses standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `time.h`, `sys/stat.h`, `errno.h`) and is compatible with most C compilers.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was created as a learning exercise in C programming.
- Inspired by file management systems found in operating systems.
